# Cloud-Data-Quality-Monitoring-AI

This project implements an automated system for monitoring and improving data quality in cloud data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake, using AI techniques and data validation frameworks. The system performs checks for missing data, duplicates, outliers, and other common data issues, and sends alerts when any data quality issues are detected.

# Project Description
The Cloud Data Quality Monitoring with AI project is designed to automate the detection of data quality issues in data warehouses by leveraging AI models and data validation frameworks. It performs regular checks on the data stored in cloud data warehouses to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and free from anomalies.

Key components of this project include:

Cloud Integration: Seamless integration with popular cloud data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery.
Automated Data Quality Monitoring: Periodic checks to detect missing values, duplicates, and other data issues.
AI-Powered Anomaly Detection: Utilizing machine learning models (like Isolation Forest or Autoencoders) to detect outliers and anomalies in large datasets.
Alerting System: Automatically notifies the relevant stakeholders via email when data quality issues are detected.

Features
Cloud Data Warehouse Integration: Connects to cloud data warehouses (Redshift, BigQuery, etc.) to fetch data for quality checks.
Data Quality Validation: Uses Great Expectations to check for common data issues like missing values, duplicate records, and schema mismatches.
AI-Based Anomaly Detection: Detects unusual patterns in data using machine learning models such as Isolation Forest or Autoencoders.
Email Alerts: Sends notifications via email to stakeholders whenever an issue is detected in the data.
Automated Process: Automatically checks data quality at set intervals using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
Installation
Clone the Repository: To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cloud-Data-Quality-Monitoring-AI.git
cd Cloud-Data-Quality-Monitoring-AI
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Cloud Credentials:

For AWS Redshift, make sure you have configured AWS CLI with access keys.
For Google BigQuery, set up your Google Cloud credentials as per their documentation.
Usage
Connect to Cloud Data Warehouse: Modify the connection settings in config/config.py for your cloud data warehouse (AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, etc.).

Run Data Quality Checks: Use the script src/data_quality.py to run data quality checks. You can also schedule it to run periodically using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

bash
Copy code
python src/data_quality.py
Check Alerts: If any data issues are found, an email alert will be sent to the configured recipients (make sure you configure your SMTP settings in the script src/alert_system.py).

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for the project.
Great Expectations: Framework for data validation.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning models (Isolation Forest, etc.).
TensorFlow/Keras: For advanced anomaly detection using Autoencoders.
AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions: For automating the periodic checks.
SMTP / Email Alerts: For sending email notifications.
Pandas / Numpy: For data manipulation.
Configuration
To configure the project for your cloud data warehouse, update the following settings in config/config.py:

Redshift:

python
Copy code
dbname = 'your-db-name'
user = 'your-db-user'
password = 'your-db-password'
host = 'your-db-host'
port = '5439'
BigQuery:

python
Copy code
project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
Make sure you store any sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) securely using environment variables or secret management tools.

AI Model Overview
This project uses machine learning models to identify outliers and anomalies in the data. The models include:

Isolation Forest: Used for detecting outliers in the dataset.
Autoencoders: A neural network architecture used for more advanced anomaly detection.
You can modify the models and their configurations in src/anomaly_detection.py to suit your data and needs.

Data Quality Checks
The project uses Great Expectations to perform various data quality checks, such as:

Missing values: Check for columns with missing or null values.
Duplicate values: Ensure there are no duplicate records in the dataset.
Schema Validation: Verify that the dataset conforms to the expected schema (correct column types, names, etc.).
All data quality checks can be found in src/data_quality.py. You can add more checks as needed.

Alerting System
The alerting system is set up in src/alert_system.py. By default, it sends email notifications when an issue is detected. You can configure the SMTP settings as follows:

python
Copy code
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.example.com'
SMTP_PORT = 587
SENDER_EMAIL = 'your-email@example.com'
RECIPIENT_EMAIL = 'recipient@example.com'
Testing
To run the unit tests for the project, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests/
This will run all the unit tests in the tests directory to ensure that the data quality checks and AI models are working correctly.

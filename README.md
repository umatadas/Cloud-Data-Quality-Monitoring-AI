# Cloud-Data-Quality-Monitoring-AI

This project implements an automated system for monitoring and improving data quality in cloud data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake, using AI techniques and data validation frameworks. The system performs checks for missing data, duplicates, outliers, and other common data issues, and sends alerts when any data quality issues are detected.

# Project Description
The Cloud Data Quality Monitoring with AI project is designed to automate the detection of data quality issues in data warehouses by leveraging AI models and data validation frameworks. It performs regular checks on the data stored in cloud data warehouses to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and free from anomalies.

Key components of this project include:

Cloud Integration: Seamless integration with popular cloud data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery.
Automated Data Quality Monitoring: Periodic checks to detect missing values, duplicates, and other data issues.
AI-Powered Anomaly Detection: Utilizing machine learning models (like Isolation Forest or Autoencoders) to detect outliers and anomalies in large datasets.
Alerting System: Automatically notifies the relevant stakeholders via email when data quality issues are detected.

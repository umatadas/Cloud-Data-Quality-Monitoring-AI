# Cloud-Data-Quality-Monitoring-AI
Overview
This project implements an automated system for monitoring and improving data quality in cloud data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake, using AI techniques and data validation frameworks. The system performs checks for missing data, duplicates, outliers, and other common data issues, and sends alerts when any data quality issues are detected.
